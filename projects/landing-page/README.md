## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Modified

1. I've added a section 4 to the main element in index.HTML file to meet specefications.
2. I've modified style.css file to make All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
3. I also have changed the navigation menu style and cursor when it hovers over the navigation menu.
4. I've built a navigation menu dynamically as an unordered list by app.js file.
5. I've built scroll links to every section in the navigation menu by an event listener method in app.js file, and also make the scroll behavior is smooth.
6. I've added an active class for both sections and the navigation list to be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
7. I've written Comments to explain long codes when necessary.
8. I've used the document fragment method in javascript to prevent much overflow.
